She talkin in head karma got my dreads saying Starr step it up
Cause the city dead And the city red I put my flag down
Creek City holmie I hold hood down dread in my head
Tat it on my arm spilled blood for'em I tell'em fight on run
We are the city nigga beat'em without a gun
Lose souls set'em free so here it starts

Banish my soul um stepping outta body on a molly & beer
Thru the city I appear just another lost soul drawing closer coming near
Lost pieces of the puzzle shed a tear and hear me "RIP BIG NAY"
They say that Satan still dreams so cursed he without soul stand bold and pledge the
Sacrifice your own life to see what they see and in the heat of battle you learn life can be
One of GOD precious moments so wake and stand for a cause reunite dey can't take us
And if they try to take Us we gone march through the state bra
And KING had a dream so can we til you wake up Yah Yeah

She talkin in head karma got my dreads saying Starr step it up
